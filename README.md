### General

- <https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems>
  - This is an article by James Clear, author of [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), which I also recommend.
- <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/goal-setting-vs-system-setting-identity-setting-kerry-secrest/>
  - This is a related short article on the different effects of goals, systems, and self-identification.
- <https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/systems-vs-goals>
  - And yet another.
- <https://steve-yegge.medium.com/get-that-job-at-grab-eea6de1d8421>
  - I found this while searching for Yegge’s Google interview advice I read before interviewing at Google (and getting hired) in 2013.
  - It’s quite interesting and useful.
  - It actually predicts the hiring “market correction” from 2018 which is a sad way to be accurate.
  - The older version of his advise I read of this was <https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html> 
  - Which led me to get a copy of [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Computer-Science-dp-3030542580/dp/3030542580/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) by Skiena which turned out to be one of my favorite books.
- <https://algodaily.com/blog/managing-your-career-in-a-downturn>
- <https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/>
  - This guide by Google has a lot of relevant material for career development, including [interview prep](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/interview/), [data structures & algorithms](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/), and [software engineering principles](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/principles/).
- <https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/>
- <https://www.interviewcake.com/coding-interview-tips>
  - Despite the URL and title, this is not all about the coding question.

### What to Expect at Interviews

### System Design

- <https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer>
  - I recommend starting with this one.
- <https://algodaily.com/sections/systems-design> 
  - This one has a good broad set of system design topics.
  - This company has lessons, tutorials, and courses online, including some free resources.
- Kleppmann, M. (2017). [*Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063). United States: O'Reilly Media.
  - This book is one of my all time favorites.
- <https://github.com/madd86/awesome-system-design>
  - Curated, large list of resources.
- <https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/ds4/>
  - This is a book that you can get free online (or order).
  - The author also has some [slides and notes](https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/teaching-distributed-systems/) from a course.
- <https://sre.google/workbook/non-abstract-design/>
- <https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-Insiders-Guide-ebook/dp/B08B3FWYBX>

### Data Structures and Algorithms

- [Seven (7) Essential Data Structures for a Coding Interview and associated common questions](https://towardsdatascience.com/seven-7-essential-data-structures-for-a-coding-interview-and-associated-common-questions-72ceb644290)

  - This Medium article from [*Towards Data Science*](https://towardsdatascience.com/) (one of my favorite online places to find articles) is good for a quick summary or review.

- I recommend the [*Algorithm Design Manual*](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Computer-Science-dp-3030542580/dp/3030542580/) by Skiena (listed in references)

- <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-algorithms-in-interview-questions/>
  - This is a more in depth article online if you don’t want to read/invest in a book.

### Example Coding Questions mostly on DS/Algos

Both of these articles have example coding questions by category.

### Mock Interviews

- <https://interviewing.io/>
  - Free mock interviews. I do not have experience with this personally but of the ones I know of it looks relatively legit.
  - They have [recorded mock interviews](https://interviewing.io/mocks) by others you can watch.
